## Repository for Fink.
##
## This is commented out by default, so you'll need to explicitly enable
## it if you want it. Consider it highly experimental -- using this
## version of apt-get/dpkg with Fink's repositories won't be supported
## by anybody.
##
## Fink doesn't provide packages for darwin-amd64, so if you're running
## on a 64-bit machine and you want to use these repositories, you'll
## need to force apt-get into running in darwin-i386 mode:
##
## sudo arch -i386 apt-get update
## sudo arch -i386 apt-get install <package>
##
## For this to work, you'll also need to tell dpkg to ignore architecture
## mismatches, by putting:
##
## force-architecture
##
## ...in /usr/local/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg
##
## If you're feeling particularly brave and don't have any need to
## install darwin-amd64 packages, you could override apt's architecture
## via the APT::Architecture configuration option. YMMV.
